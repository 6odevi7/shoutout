Architecture Overview:

Frontend: React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering and improved SEO
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB for flexibility with user data and posts
Real-time updates: Socket.io for live feed and messaging
Authentication: JWT for secure, stateless authentication
State Management: Redux for global state management
Styling: Styled-components for component-based styling
API: RESTful API for most operations, GraphQL for complex data fetching
Deployment: Docker containers with Kubernetes for scalability
Version Control: Git with GitHub for collaboration and version tracking
